# Pixie
## About
Pixie is an image(s) labeling/annotation application which allows the user to label his images using the follwings:
- Bounding box
- Polygon
- Free hand drawing
- Semantic segmentation
- Scene/Frame annotation

Before using Pixie, we highly recomand to read the [user manual](https://github.com/buni-rock/Pixie/wiki/User-Manual). Alternatively the user manual can be found in Pixie's deliverables.

As it is very well known, an image is worth a thousound words, so here there are some output images labeled using Pixie
